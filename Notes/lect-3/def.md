1) What def does (definition time)

When the Python interpreter executes the def add(a, b): line it creates a function object (a block of executable code) and binds that object to the name add.

Important: The body of the function (return a + b) is not run now — it’s just stored.

2) What happens when you call add(5, 3)

print(add(5, 3)) asks Python to call the function add with the arguments 5 and 3.

A new local scope is created for that call. Inside the function:

a = 5, b = 3

Python evaluates a + b → 5 + 3 → 8

return 8 sends the value 8 back to the caller and immediately exits the function.

3) Why return matters

return both produces a value for the caller and stops further execution inside the function.

Any code after return in the function will never run.

Example:
```py
def add(a, b):
    print("starting")
    return a + b
    print("this never prints")
```

4) What if a function has no return?

If there’s no return, the function returns None by default.
```py
def f():
    pass

print(f())   # prints: None
```
5) Why we use def (benefits)

Reusability: Write once, call many times.

Abstraction: Hide details — callers only need to know the name and arguments.

Organization / Readability: Break complex tasks into small named pieces.

Testing & Debugging: Test a function independently.

Avoid repetition: Follow DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself).

Scope control: Local variables inside a function don’t clutter the global scope.

First-class objects: Functions can be passed as arguments, returned from other functions, stored in variables.

6) Small improvements / best practices

Use meaningful names (add_numbers is clearer than add sometimes).

Add a docstring and optional type hints:
```py
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    """Return the sum of a and b."""
    return a + b
```
