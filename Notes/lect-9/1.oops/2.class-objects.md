## Class and Object in Python


### Define a class:

```py
class Car:
    # attributes (variables)
    brand = "Toyota"
    color = "Red"
    
    # method (function inside class)
    def drive(self):
        print("The car is driving.")


Create an object: #It can create multiple times

my_car = Car()      # object created
print(my_car.brand) # Toyota
my_car.drive()      # The car is driving.

```
