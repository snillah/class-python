# 1) What is OOP?

## Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a way of structuring programs using:

`Classes` â†’ blueprints/templates.

`Objects` â†’ real instances created from classes.

## Example in real life:

Class = "Car" (design/blueprint).

Object = "My red Toyota" (real car made from blueprint).

# 2) Why OOP?

Organizes code better.
Reusable (create multiple objects from one class).
Helps with real-world modeling (students, employees, bank accounts).
Makes code easier to maintain & extend.

# 3) Class and Object in Python

## define a class

```py

class Car:
    # attributes (variables)
    brand = "Toyota"
    color = "Red"
    
    # method (function inside class)
    def drive(self):
        print("The car is driving.")

```

Create an object:

```py
my_car = Car()      # object created
print(my_car.brand) # Toyota
my_car.drive()      # The car is driving.

```


# Summary

Class = blueprint.

Object = instance of a class.

__init__ = constructor for initializing objects.

OOP Principles:

Encapsulation

Inheritance

Polymorphism

Abstraction

Abstraction â†’ hiding implementation details, showing only essentials.
ðŸ‘‰ Achieved using abstract classes (via abc module).
