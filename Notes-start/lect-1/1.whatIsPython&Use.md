# What is Python:

Python is a high-level,
general-purpose programming language known for its 
    - simplicity, 
    - readability and 
    - versatility. 

It was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991 and has since become one of the most popular programming languages worldwide.

# Key Features of Python:

Easy to Learn & Readable → Syntax is simple and close to English.

Interpreted Language → Runs line by line, no need for compilation.

Cross-Platform → Works on Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.

Dynamically Typed → No need to declare variable types explicitly.

Huge Standard Library & Community Support → Ready-to-use modules and packages.

# Uses of Python:

Python is widely used in many fields, such as:

# Web Development

Frameworks like Django, Flask, FastAPI.

Example: Building websites, APIs, e-commerce platforms.

# Data Science & Machine Learning

Libraries: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow, PyTorch.

Example: Data analysis, predictive modeling, AI.

# Automation & Scripting

Writing small scripts to automate repetitive tasks.

Example: File handling, sending emails, web scraping.

# Game Development
